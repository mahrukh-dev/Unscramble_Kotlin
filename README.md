# Functionality Implemented

## View Model Class

The **View Model Class** is a crucial component in our app's architecture. It serves as the bridge between the UI components and the underlying data, providing a way to store and manage UI-related data. By separating the UI logic from the data, the View Model Class enhances the app's maintainability and scalability. This class is responsible for handling business logic, data retrieval, and communication with the data source. With the View Model Class in place, our app ensures efficient data management and a responsive user interface.

## Fragment Class

In our app, the **Fragment Class** plays a pivotal role in creating dynamic and modular UI components. Fragments are self-contained modules that represent a portion of the UI's behavior and appearance. By using fragments, we can build flexible and reusable UI components that can be combined in various ways to create a cohesive user interface. Each Fragment Class is associated with its own lifecycle, allowing us to manage its state and interactions independently. This approach facilitates better code organization and user experience customization.
